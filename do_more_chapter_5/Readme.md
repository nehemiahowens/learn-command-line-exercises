# Chapter 5: Change Directory (cd)

## Do More

### cd to the joe directory with one command.

``` Nehemiahs-MacBook-Pro:temp $ cd stuff/things/places/people/```

### cd back to temp with one command, but not further above that.

``` Nehemiahs-MacBook-Pro:people $ cd ../../../../```

### Find out how to cd to your "home directory" with one command.

``` Nehemiahs-MacBook-Pro:temp $ cd ~/```

### cd to your Documents directory, then find it with your GUI file browser (Finder, Windows Explorer, etc.).

``` Nehemiahs-MacBook-Pro:~ $ cd Documents```
 
### cd to your Downloads directory, then find it with your file browser.

```Nehemiahs-MacBook-Pro:Documents $ cd ..
   Nehemiahs-MacBook-Pro:~ $ cd Downloads```

### Find another directory with your file browser, then cd to it.

```Nehemiahs-MacBook-Pro:Downloads $ cd ~
   Nehemiahs-MacBook-Pro:~ $ ls
   Desktop                                  Pictures
   Documents                                Public
   Downloads                                Searching “All My Files”.savedSearch
   I love SNRKS                             Sites
   Library                                  temp
   Movies                                   workspace
   Music
   Nehemiahs-MacBook-Pro:~ $ cd Library/
   Nehemiahs-MacBook-Pro:Library $```

### Remember when you put quotes around a directory with spaces in it? You can do that with any command. For example, if you have a directory I Have Fun, then you can do: cd "I Have Fun"

``` Nehemiahs-MacBook-Pro:Library $ cd ~
    Nehemiahs-MacBook-Pro:~ $ cd I\ love\ SNRKS/```
