# Chapter 6: List Directory (ls)

## Do More

### On Unix, try the ls -lR command while you're in temp.

``` Nehemiahs-MacBook-Pro:temp $ ls -lr
    total 0
    drwxr-xr-x  2 User  staff   68 Jun 14 12:44 things
    drwxr-xr-x  3 User  staff  102 Jun 14 12:47 stuff```

### Use cd to get to other directories on your computer then use ls to see what's in them.

``` Nehemiahs-MacBook-Pro:temp $ cd ..
    Nehemiahs-MacBook-Pro:~ $ cd Desktop
    Nehemiahs-MacBook-Pro:Desktop $ ls

### Update your notebook with new questions. I know you probably have some, because I'm not covering everything about this command.

### Remember that if you get lost, then use ls and pwd to figure out where you are, then go to where you need to be with cd.
