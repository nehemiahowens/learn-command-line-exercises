# Chapter 4: Make a directory (mkdir)

## Do More

### The concept of a "path" might confuse you at this point. Don't worry. We'll do a lot more with them and then you'll get it.

### Make 20 other directories inside the temp directory in various levels. Go look at them with a graphical file browser.

``` Nehemiahs-MacBook-Pro:~ $ mkdir temp/stuff/things/places/people/mark/john/jacob/jonah/jessica/janet/james/jack/jerry/julie/jackson/josiah/mike/michelle/marry```

### Make a directory with a space in the name by putting quotes around it

``` Nehemiahs-MacBook-Pro:~ $ mkdir "I love SNRKS"```
